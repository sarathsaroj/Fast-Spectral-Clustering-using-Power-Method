In our exploration, we assess the efficiencies of classical and fast spectral clustering techniques
using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark. By implementing and rigorously comparing
these methodologies, we gauge their performance across execution times and clustering metrics
such as the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).
The results illuminate the substantial computational speedup achieved by the fast spectral
clustering method without compromising, and occasionally enhancing, the clustering quality.
